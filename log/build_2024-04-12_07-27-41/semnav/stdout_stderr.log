[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findobject_pose_interface_msgs.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "object_pose_interface_msgs", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "object_pose_interface_msgs" with any of the following names:

    object_pose_interface_msgsConfig.cmake
    object_pose_interface_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "object_pose_interface_msgs" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "object_pose_interface_msgs_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "object_pose_interface_msgs"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
